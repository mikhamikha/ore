ABOUT THIS DEMO
This project demonstrates how to use the Noritake_VFD_GU3000
code library to print a simple message to the Noritake GU-3000
Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) modules. You MUST download and
install the Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code library before running the
demo.

    http://www.noritake-elec.com

Please refer to the instructions on the download page and
"README" included with the Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code library for
information on how to install the Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code
library and demos.  This document assumes that you have already
configured the "config.h" file in the Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code
library as described in those documents.

For more information on the methods used in this document,
please refer to the method documentation in the
Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code library.

----------------------------------------------------------------
KEY POINTS
1) Initialize the module with GU3000_init().
2) Use print() to print a string to print a C string to the
   module at the current position.

----------------------------------------------------------------
